Simon game

1. Description

I built this game for a project in week 3 of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It is a memory game in which the player has to repeat an ever increasing series of visual/audio cues produced by the computer (Simon).

The project requirements were:

    • Render a game in the browser
    • Switch turns between two players
    • Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
    • Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
    • Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
    • Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
    • Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
    • Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


2. Technology

HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Sound Manager


2. Third party resources

    • freeSFX.co.uk
    • Google Fonts
    • Pivotal Tracker
    • balsamiq


3. Approach

• I set out user stories in Pivotal Tracker (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1494094), grading them and sorting them into four epics: Display, Gameplay, Intro and Extensions. I made elimentary wireframes in balsamiq.

• I prioritised the Display and Gameplay epics, aiming to have an MVP from these user stories.



4. Result

• I completed 5 out of 12 user stories, producing a functioning game with an intro and an outro, but failed introduce a second player or any of the extensions.


5. Unsolved aspects of the game
    
    • Two player participation and associated navigation/displays.
    • Cue variations (audio only, text only, audio and text)
    • Difficulty levels
    • Player icons
    • Better audio – pitched sine waves and digitized voice accompanying intro and outro


6. Conclusions

The game enabled me to inprove my Javascript logic, jQuery functions and syntax, and CSS. I also learned a great deal about planning – I found that I underestimated the amount of time needed to work on particular aspects:

    • Gameplay logic, esp. comparing the player sequence against the computer sequence. 
    • Intro/Outro    
    • Debugging: there were bugs at virtually every stage and far more than I anticipated.

I was pleased with how I used the CSS and jQuery in particular.

In future I will look more carefully at the user stories and consider these in more detail in relation to the code required as well as to the user.
